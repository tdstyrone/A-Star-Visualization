# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
This is an A* pathfinding algorithm visualization. I was really interested in learning about algorithms and so, I decided to visualize how this algroithm works. Have fun playing around with the Visulization tool!! 

## Technologies Used
These can be found in the requirements.txt folder:
* [Pygame Module]

## Basic Controls
You must create two endpoint in which the algorithm will seek to connect. The **START** node is **_YELLOW_** and the **END** node is **_RED_**

To create nodes:
  - Start: First Left-click 
  - End: Second Left-Click
  - Wall: Left-Click after placing Start and End
  
To delete nodes:
  - Right-Click on wall node
  
To Run:
  - Hit SPACEBAR!!
  
To Clear Screen:
  - Hit "C"
  
### Preview
Below is a sample of the code running:
