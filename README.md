# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
This is an A* pathfinding algorithm visualization. The program is built using the pygame module in python to visualize how the algroithm works. 

## Technologies Used
These can be found in the requirements.txt folder:
* [Pygame Module]

## Basic Controls
You must create two endpoint in which the algorithm will seek to connect. The **START** node is **_YELLOW_** and the **END** node is **_RED_**

To create nodes:
  - Start: First Left-click 
  - End: Second Left-Click
  - Wall: Left-Click after placing Start and End
  
To delete nodes:
  - Right-Click on wall node
  
To Run:
  - Hit SPACEBAR!!
  
To Clear Screen:
  - Hit "c"
